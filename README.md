TLDR: Community is very important, consider change management methods, different people will want different encouragement. Links to articles, videos and books.

<b>Tooling:</b></br>
Tooling within DevOps is an important topic and one that's often fixated on. It would be easy if you could buy a tool which enabled a team to be a highly-able, agile, collaborative team but there's no silver bullet here. If teams don't want to work together giving them a method of working together will not fix it.
&nbsp;That said, in our increasingly distributed and asynchronously communicated world tools are needed to fill specific requirements in teams.
</br>
</br>
Consider Chat-ops tools like Slack or Hip Chat to communicate asynchronlously. Video Conference tools let people interact in a more natural way. Put all of the configuration that's used more than a few times in it's lifetime in code. For infrastructure automation, application delivery and compliance check out like http://chef.io (plug over).
That said this document is focused on practices for adopting culture so I'm going to leave the tooling there.
</br>
</br>
Community is what's allowed Chef to grow since it began in 2009. This same collaborative method is needed to help it thrive in your organisation too. Meet-ups (internal and external), Lunch and Learns, Mentoring, surgeries (the attendees pick the topics) help bring people together.

<b>Change Management</b></br>
In essence once you have all the tools you need, and there’s a procedure set out and shared. The problem boils down to a question of influencing people to change, and usually this comes down to a cultural shift. It may not be in your company, perhaps it’s just a tweak to normal practice.</br>
The principals of getting change in place and making it stick have been nicely set-out since the 1990s. </br>
See “Kotter’s Eight Stages of Successful Change”</br>
&nbsp;  0. Establish a ‘sense of urgency’</br>
&nbsp;	1. Form a powerful guiding coalition</br>
&nbsp;	2. Creating a vision</br>
&nbsp;	3. Communicating a vision</br>
&nbsp;	4. Empower others to act on the vision</br>
&nbsp;	5. Planning for and creating short-term wins</br>
&nbsp;	6. Consolidating Improvements and producing still more change</br>
&nbsp;	7. Institutionalizing new approaches</br>
</br></br>
There’s a nice article on it here: https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/resources/marketing/docs/95204f2.pdf

<b>Individuals and Change:</b></br>
Thinking about change from the individual rather than the organisation, we see three types of people when taking on a new challenge like Chef:</br>
A minority of people want to adopt early; they need: </br>
· Freedom / permission to learn, </br>
· Recognition for progress.</br>
· Meaningful projects to apply the technology to.</br>
· Places to publish their learning</br>
The majority will willingly learn; they need:</br>
· Mentorship</br>
· Training materials </br>
· Internal/external accreditation as milestones</br>
· Recognition</br>
A minority will typically be reluctant to take on the additional learning. </br>
&nbsp;	This is an influence problem and is difficult, possible tactics are:</br>
· “Without learning this new skill to work with the new system how can they deliver their value to the company?” </br>
· “Do they recognise that this is an industry trend, what does this mean for them in the industry?” </br>
· Pairing (with a domain competent person), with the person new to it driving.</br>
· Sharing success stories from other newcomers who have succeeded in learning the new skill.</br>
· Mentorship</br>
· Oversight</br>
</br></br>
Situational Leadership (SL2) has some nice models to follow for these situations Article, This would be a D2 – a disillusioned learner (un-motivated but has very transferable skills). Coaching method for this would be an S2 (coaching and selling to the individual the need for change).
