TLDR: Community is very important, consider change management methods, different people will want different encouragement. Links to articles, videos and books.

Tooling:</br> 
&nbsp;	Tooling within DevOps is an important topic and one that's often fixated on. It would be easy if you could buy a tool which enabled a team to be a highly-able, agile, collaborative team but there's no silver bullet here. If teams don't want to work together giving them a method of working together will not fix it.
&nbsp;	That said, in our increasingly distributed and asynchronously communicated world tools are needed to fill specific requirements in teams.
</br>	 
&nbsp;	Consider Chat-ops tools like Slack or Hip Chat to communicate asynchronlously. Video Conference tools let people interact in a more natural way. Put all of the configuration that's used more than a few times in it's lifetime in code. For infrastructure automation, application delivery and compliance check out like http://chef.io (plug over).
That said this document is focused on practices for adopting culture so I'm going to leave the tooling there.
</br>	 
Community is what's allowed Chef to grow since it began in 2009. This same collaborative method is needed to help it thrive in your organisation too. Meet-ups (internal and external), Lunch and Learns, Mentoring, surgeries (the attendees pick the topics) help bring people together.

Change Management, In essence once you have all the tools you need, and there’s a procedure set out and shared. The problem boils down to a question of influencing people to change, and usually this comes down to a cultural shift. It may not be in your company, perhaps it’s just a tweak to normal practice.
The principals of getting change in place and making it stick have been nicely set-out since the 1990s. 
See “Kotter’s Eight Stages of Successful Change”
1. Establish a ‘sense of urgency’
&nbsp;	1. Form a powerful guiding coalition
&nbsp;	2. Creating a vision
&nbsp;	3. Communicating a vision
&nbsp;	4. Empower others to act on the vision.
&nbsp;	5. Planning for and creating short-term wins
&nbsp;	6. Consolidating Improvements and producing still more change
&nbsp;	7. Institutionalizing new approaches
</br>
There’s a nice article on it here: https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/resources/marketing/docs/95204f2.pdf

Individuals and Change:</br>
Thinking about change from the individual rather than the organisation, we see three types of people when taking on a new challenge like Chef:
A minority of people want to adopt early; they need: 
· Freedom / permission to learn, 
· Recognition for progress.
· Meaningful projects to apply the technology to.
· Places to publish their learning
The majority will willingly learn; they need:
· Mentorship
· Training materials 
· Internal/external accreditation as milestones
· Recognition
A minority will typically be reluctant to take on the additional learning. 
&nbsp;	This is an influence problem and is difficult, possible tactics are:
· “Without learning this new skill to work with the new system how can they deliver their value to the company?” 
· “Do they recognise that this is an industry trend, what does this mean for them in the industry?” 
· Pairing (with a domain competent person), with the person new to it driving.
· Sharing success stories from other newcomers who have succeeded in learning the new skill.
· Mentorship
· Oversight
</br></br>
Situational Leadership (SL2) has some nice models to follow for these situations Article, This would be a D2 – a disillusioned learner (un-motivated but has very transferable skills). Coaching method for this would be an S2 (coaching and selling to the individual the need for change). 
 </br></br>
Chef do offer the service of a DevOps Journey Assessment which works with you to set-out a plan for how to get from where you are today. Going through to where you want to be and the milestones and methods to move the culture in that direction.
